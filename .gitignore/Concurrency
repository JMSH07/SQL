#2. Uncommitted dependency (dirty read): one begin when other calculate
#3. Inconsistent analysis problem: occurs when a transaction reads several values from the database but a second transaction 
##                                 updates some of them during the execution of the first. 
##2-phase locking (2PL):A transaction follows the two-phase locking protocol if all locking opera- tions precede the first 
##                      unlock operation in the transaction.
##                      first a growing phase, in which it acquires all the locks needed but cannot release any locks, 
##                      and then a shrinking phase, in which it releases its locks but cannot acquire any new locks.
